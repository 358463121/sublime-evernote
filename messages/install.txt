Evernote for ST3
================

Thanks for installing the Evernote plugin.

To start using it install it from Package Control and type "Evernote" on the Command Pallette (ctrl+shift+p).
See the README and the [wiki] for more details about the commands.

When you first run this package from the command palette, it will launch a browser window with your Evernote developer token. Copy the token and paste it into the prompt at the bottom of your Sublime window.
Sublime will store the authentication data in `Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Evernote.sublime-settings`.

> **PLEASE NOTE**
> 
> The authentication method makes use of the Developer Token
> which is unique to your account and grants read-write access
> to your Evernote.
> This token will be saved in your user settings
> in the `Evernote.sublime-settings` file,
> so make sure you do not share this publicly!
