# Contributing

Contributions to the package are very welcome.

If you find a bug or want to post a feature request use the [issues](https://github.com/bordaigorl/sublime-evernote/issues) page.

The preferred workflow is forking
<https://github.com/bordaigorl/sublime-evernote>
then creating a new branch for each new feature/bugfix and submitting a pull request so that we can discuss and integrate it in the next release.

New features should be forked from the `devel` branch, holding changes that will go in the next major release, while bug-fixes can be forked from the `master` branch so they can be integrated as a minor release.
