SublimeEvernote
===============

[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin for [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com)

This package combines [jamiesun](https://github.com/jamiesun)'s original plugin with [rekotan](https://github.com/rekotan)'s update. Jamiesun's original package doesn't work for me because it attempts to authenticate via the (now) outdated Userstore.authenticate. Rekotan updated the package to use a proper token; however, the update also sends the markdown as preformatted text. I prefer to transform the Markdown to Evernote rich text, and if you're of the same mind, then this is your Sublime-Evernote package.

I did little work here--merely cobbling together the efforts of the original pacakge and a fork.
